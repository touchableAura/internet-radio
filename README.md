This React Native App is an online radio interface for 7 of my most listened to online radio stations. It's basically a simplified way for me to get something closer to an actual radio interface. This allowed me to program the buttons to station I like in a way that wasn't available with other online radios or physical radios.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS 

note: if you are on a mac/ different os, you may need to look up the keyboard shortcut/ terminal input alternatives for things to work properly.

1) clone the repo
2) open with IDE like VS Code
3) open a terminal window (ctl + ~) 
4) download dependencies (npm i)
5) run the program (npm run start)
6) run on browser (w)

From here, a new browser window should open using your system's default browser. The rest is pretty straight forward. You hit the buttons, the corresponding radio station's live stream begins to play. 

The stations included in this radio player are are independent. The stations are: CKDU, CJLO, WNYC, WFMU, KEXP, KCRW, and NTS.
